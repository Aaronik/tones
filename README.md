# Tones

Serverless multiplayer musical instrument, built on canvas

## Releasing:
* Nav to master branch, run `npm run release` and the script should take care of all the rest.

## Terminlogy:
* A "tone" is a single clickable square. It's also the data structure the square represents.
* The "matrix" is all around us. Jkizzle it's the whole collection of tones.

#### TODO
* Get minified in production, unminified in dev
* Add tones, spaced and aligned correctly
* Add events when moused over
* Add timer, show columns chiming
* Add sound, single instrument
* Add multiple instruments
* Add multiplayer functionality
